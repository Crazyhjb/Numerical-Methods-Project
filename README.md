# Numerical-Methods-Project
This project is a test of my numerical methods in python and using said methods to imitate partial differential equations. This was applied to the Time independent steady state heat equation and One-Dimensional Heat equation. 

Due to external reasons the report that was written with it was unable to be edited and checked over. Therefore there are lots of grammatical and spelling errors. When I have time I will be editing the final report to remove said errors.

Please @me if you wish to ask any questions. I will do my best to respond
